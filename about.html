                            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                        </div>
                        <p>Aurelian Jets is a private aviation brokerage built for clients who refuse to compromise. We connect discerning travelers with FAA-certified Part 135 operators, handling every detail from initial inquiry to wheels-up — and everything in between.</p>
                        <p>Our name draws from the Latin <em>aureus</em> — gold. It represents our standard: nothing less than excellence in every interaction, every flight, every outcome.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="legal-section">
                        <div class="legal-section-header">
                            <span class="legal-section-number">02</span>
                            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                        </div>
                        <p>Private aviation should be seamless, not stressful. Too often, charter experiences are fragmented — unclear pricing, unreliable operators, and no accountability when things go wrong.</p>
                        <p>We exist to change that. Aurelian Jets provides a single point of coordination with complete transparency, vetted operators, and a commitment to getting you where you need to be — on time, every time.</p>
                    </div>

                            <h2>What Sets Us Apart</h2>
                        </div>
                        <p>We're not just another broker. We're your aviation partner.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Guaranteed Arrival:</strong> Our signature service builds redundancy into every critical trip. If your primary aircraft becomes unavailable, we activate backup solutions — because missing your moment is not an option.</li>
                            <li><strong>Vetted Operators Only:</strong> Every carrier in our network is FAA-certified, independently verified, and held to the highest safety and service standards.</li>
                            <li><strong>Transparent Pricing:</strong> No hidden fees. No surprise charges. You'll know exactly what you're paying for before you commit.</li>
                            <li><strong>24/7 Concierge Support:</strong> From booking to landing, our team is available around the clock. One call. One point of contact. Complete peace of mind.</li>
                            <li><strong>Empty-Leg Intelligence:</strong> We monitor repositioning flights across our network, offering significant savings on one-way routes when schedules align.</li>
                        </ul>

                        </div>
                        <p>We believe private aviation should adapt to you — not the other way around. That means:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Flexibility First:</strong> Plans change. We make adjustments easy, with clear policies and responsive service.</li>
                            <li><strong>Discretion Always:</strong> Your travel is your business. We maintain strict confidentiality in every aspect of our service.</li>
                            <li><strong>Relationships Over Transactions:</strong> We're building long-term partnerships, not processing bookings. Your preferences, your history, your priorities — we remember them all.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
